        <!-- about me -->

        <h3 id="abtme">About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm finishing up my 4th year as a Computer Science major. I was born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq up until I was 7 years old.
            I immigrated to San Jose, California and have lived there ever since. I've always been interested in software and computers, 
            but I wasn't sure if it was something I wanted to pursue until my junior year of high school! I'm passionate about
            programming and view it as a tool to help people improve their life in some way. My main goal is to use technology and software
            as a means of improving people's mental health.
        </p>
